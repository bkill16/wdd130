        <h3>Where to Ride</h3>
        <p>
        <p>WHERE TO RIDE: The Idaho wilderness provides a wide variety of terrain. From rugged, rocky hills to vast,
            flat meadows and
            anything in between, there’s something for everyone. Experienced riders can take on challenging trails and
            those who are just starting out can cruise on something a little easier. Idaho’s trails can lead you to
            beautiful places. Hidden mountain lakes, sharp peaks, and peaceful wildflower meadows are all sights just
            waiting for you to behold. If you’re wondering where to ride, we’ve got you covered.</p>
        <p>SPENCER: Located just an hour north of Idaho Falls, Spencer, Idaho features a range of motorized trails and
            mountain
            roads. Founded in 1879, Spencer was a railroad town. Large deposits of opals and precious gems were
            discovered in the area in 1948, and Spencer famously contains some of the largest opal mines in the United
            States. Along with good trail rides and camping, tourists can have the unique experience of mining for their
            own opals at the Spencer Opal Mine as well.
            Much of Spencer’s trails can be found in the Stoddard Creek camping area. Stoddard Creek is located a few
            minutes past the initial town of Spencer. If you continue travelling on I-15, you’ll come across the
            Stoddard Creek exit. Stoddard Creek features a campground that is ran by the US Forest Service as well as
            suitable camping spots along the road. Among the many trails in this area, one of the most popular is the
            City of Rocks trail. This trail provides a lengthy ride up a rocky mountain. It’s on the more challenging
            side, but it leads to the top of a shale covered hill that overlooks the mountainous valley. The “City of
            Rocks” is a collection of pathways and buildings built out of shale by people who have ridden the trail.
            The City of Rocks is just some of what Spencer has to offer. Our guides can take you and your group on an
            adventure through one of Idaho’s most beautiful areas!</p>
        <p>KELLY CANYON: Kelly Canyon is a lot more than just a ski and mountain biking resort. The Kelly Canyon area is
            full of motorized vehicle trails. Close by, it’s only about 30 minutes from Idaho Falls, near the small town
            of Ririe. Tourists can enjoy the Heise Hot Springs and campground. Pizza, zip-lining, and much more can be
            enjoyed after your ride through the canyon. One of the most popular trails in the area is a 4-mile loop.
            It’s a fun, intermediate ride that takes about
            2 hours to complete. The loop contains a range of different terrains. Much of it runs through the forested
            hills and alongside the Snake River. One of the area’s more challenging rides is the Stinking Springs trail.
            It’s a 10-mile adventure and takes
            about 5 hours to complete. This trail is rather steep and includes some switchbacks that are difficult to
            traverse. It’s perfect for intermediate-advanced and advanced riders. This canyon is full of trails that can
            satisfy any skill level. Its long loops and trails provide a whole
            day of fun. There’s something new to try each time you come!</p>
        <p>SWAN VALLEY: Swan Valley is one of Idaho’s prettiest areas. It’s only about an hour east of Idaho Falls and
            provides a wide range of recreational activities. It’s a popular area for camping, boating, and of course,
            trail riding. The small town that sits near the south fork of the Snake River is a base camp for all those
            who enjoy the activities that the valley offers. Travelers have access to an RV park in town, gas, food, and
            of course, the well-known square ice cream at Rainey Creek. Past the town, visitors can camp and ride near
            the Palisades reservoir. The area features many trails and
            dirt roads that riders can enjoy. The easier rides provide a beautiful scenic traverse through the woods. If
            you happen to go in late September or early October, the trees are painted in reds, yellows, and oranges,
            and are a captivating sight of bright, fall colors. There’s plenty of challenging terrain for more
            experienced riders as well. The Fall Creek trail takes riders
            on a long and windy adventure. The trail is steep and covered with loose rock. It takes riders up into the
            mountains and along the rugged crests. This ride is no easy feat, but the views at the top are well worth
            it.</p>
