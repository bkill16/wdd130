                    <ul>
                        <li>Trail tours welcomes unexperienced riders who want to try something new. Before they can
                            begin, however, they must spend time with an instructor.</li>
                        <li>If a trail becomes too difficult for your experience level, be honest and notify your guide.
                            If a guide feels that trail conditions are too poor, or notices a rider struggling, they
                            have the right to turn the group around and attempt another trail.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Trail Tours believes strongly that our forests should be protected. Riders participating in
                            a trail tour will leave the trail looking better than they found it.</li>
                        <li>Riders will not deviate from the designated trail. It damages the environment.</li>
                        <li>Riders will keep to the right of roads and wide trails. Just like any other road, there will
                            be other riders or oncoming traffic.</li>
                        <li>If travelling in a group and passing other riders on the trail, each rider will notify
                            everyone they pass of how many are coming behind them.</li>
