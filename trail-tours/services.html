                <h3>Rentals</h3>
                <p>If you want to give trail riding a try, but don’t want to spend thousands of dollars, Trail Tours has
                    a few vehicles and safety equipment available to rent.</p>
                <p class="rentals-heading">Vehicle Rentals</p>
                <p>To rent a vehicle, call or email us to set up your rental appointment. At your rental appointment
                    you’ll be given a rental contract and waivers to go over and sign. The rental contract and waiver
                    include usage agreements and commitments to pay for any damages. The price to rent is $50.00 per
                    hour. You are responsible for transporting the vehicles.</p>
                <p class="rentals-heading">Equipment Rentals</p>
                <p>All riders, no matter the vehicle type, are required to wear a DOT approved helmet. We have a variety
                    of styles and sizes to choose from. We require all dirt bike riders to wear riding boots. If you
                    don’t own boots, we have some available to rent. If you do not own proper safety equipment, contact
                    us and set up your rental appointment. You will be required to sign a rental contract that includes
                    usage agreements and commitments to pay to repair or replace any damaged equipment.</p>
