                    <h4>The Idaho wilderness provides a wide variety of terrain. From rugged, rocky hills to vast, flat

                        peaceful wildflower meadows are all sights just waiting for you to behold. If you’re wondering

                <h3>Spencer, Idaho</h3>
                <p>Located just an hour north of Idaho Falls, Spencer, Idaho features a range of
                    motorized trails and mountain roads. Founded in 1879, Spencer was a railroad town. Large deposits of
                    opals and precious gems were discovered in the area in 1948, and Spencer famously contains some of
                    the largest opal mines in the United States. Along with good trail rides and camping, tourists can
                    have the unique experience of mining for their own opals at the Spencer Opal Mine as well.</p>
                <p>Much of Spencer’s trails can be found in the Stoddard Creek camping area.
                    Stoddard Creek is located a few minutes past the initial town of Spencer. If you continue travelling
                    on I-15, you’ll come across the Stoddard Creek exit. Stoddard Creek features a campground that is
                    ran by the US Forest Service as well as suitable camping spots along the road. Among the many trails
                    in this area, one of the most popular is the City of Rocks trail. This trail provides a lengthy ride
                    up a rocky mountain. It’s on the more challenging side, but it leads to the top of a shale covered
                    hill that overlooks the mountainous valley. The “City of Rocks” is a collection of pathways and
                    buildings built out of shale by people who have ridden the trail.</p>
                <p>The City of Rocks is just some of what Spencer has to offer. Our guides can
                    take you and your group on an adventure through one of Idaho’s most beautiful areas!</p>

                    Kelly Canyon area is full of motorized vehicle trails. Close by, it’s only about 30 minutes from
                    Idaho Falls, near the small town of Ririe. Tourists can enjoy the Heise Hot Springs and campground.
                    Pizza, zip-lining, and much more can be enjoyed after your ride through the canyon.</p>

                    intermediate ride that takes about 2 hours to complete. The loop contains a range of different
                    terrains. Much of it runs through the forested hills and alongside the Snake River.</p>
                <p>One of the area’s more challenging rides is the Stinking Springs trail. It’s a
                    10-mile adventure and takes about 5 hours to complete. This trail is rather steep and includes some
                    switchbacks that are difficult to traverse. It’s perfect for intermediate-advanced and advanced
                    riders.</p>
                <p>This canyon is full of trails that can satisfy any skill level. Its long loops

                <h3>Swan Valley, Idaho</h3>
                <p>Swan Valley is one of Idaho’s prettiest areas. It’s only about an hour east of
                    Idaho Falls and provides a wide range of recreational activities. It’s a popular area for camping,
                    boating, and of course, trail riding. The small town that sits near the south fork of the Snake
                    River is a base camp for all those who enjoy the activities that the valley offers. Travelers have
                    access to an RV park in town, gas, food, and of course, the well-known square ice cream at Rainey
                    Creek.</p>
                <p>Past the town, visitors can camp and ride near the Palisades reservoir. The
                    area features many trails and dirt roads that riders can enjoy. The easier rides provide a beautiful
                    scenic traverse through the woods. If you happen to go in late September or early October, the trees
                    are painted in reds, yellows, and oranges, and are a captivating sight of bright, fall colors.</p>
                <p>There’s plenty of challenging terrain for more experienced riders as well. The
                    Fall Creek trail takes riders on a long and windy adventure. The trail is steep and covered with
                    loose rock. It takes riders up into the mountains and along the rugged crests. This ride is no easy
                    feat, but the views at the top are well worth it.</p>
